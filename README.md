# To-Do List Application

## Project Description

This application is a basic To-Do List python app that will allow users that run the app to add tasks, mark them as complete, remove them from the complete or incomplete lists, and view the complete and incomplete task lists. 
This app was built as a display of my knowledge of Python that I have accumulated since enrolling in Coding Temple. 

## Installation and Use Instructions

This app can be downloaded off of my github page and once in a python interpreter will work through inputs in the terminal.
